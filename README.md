Python solutions of Google Kick Start 2020. Solution begins with `*` means it will get TLE in the largest data set (total computation amount > `10^8`, which is not friendly for Python to solve in 5 ~ 15 seconds). A problem was marked as `Very Hard` means that it was an unsolved one during the contest and may not be that difficult.
